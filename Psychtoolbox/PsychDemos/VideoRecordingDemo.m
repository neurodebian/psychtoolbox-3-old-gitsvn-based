function VideoRecordingDemo(moviename, codec, withsound, showit, windowed)
% VideoRecordingDemo(moviename [, codec=0] [, withsound=1] [, showit=1] [, windowed=1])
%
% Demonstrates simple video capture and recording to a movie file.
%
% Currently uses Quicktime on OS/X and GStreamer on Linux and Windows.
%
% The demo starts the videocapture engine, recording video from the default
% video source and (optionally) sound from the default audio source. It
% encodes the video+audio data with the selected 'codec' and writes it to the
% 'moviename' movie file. Optionally it previews the recorded
% video onscreen (often at a much lower framerate to keep system load low
% enough for reliable recording). Recording ends if any key is pressed on
% the keyboard.
% 
% Arguments and their meaning:
%
% 'moviename' name of output movie file. The file must not exist at start
% of recording, otherwise it is overwritten.
%
% 'codec' an (optional) number, indicating the type of video codec you want to use.
% Defaults to "whatever the system default is". Valid settings are between
% 0 and 10 on OS/X. Some codecs are very fast, i.e., high framerates and low system
% load, others provide high compression rates, i.e., small video files at
% good quality. Usually there's a tradeoff between encoding speed, quality
% and compression ratio, so you'll have to try out different ones to find
% one suitable for your purpose. Some codecs only work at specific
% framerates or for specific image sizes. If you set the level of verbosity
% of PTB on OS/X to at least 4, it will print out a list of supported codecs on
% your system (Screen('Preference', 'Verbosity', 4)).
% Without Quicktime-Pro on OS/X, you'll usually only have a very limited set of
% codecs available - often only the default codec, so purchase of a
% Quicktime-Pro license key is a good investment if you want to do serious
% recording work. Or you use the GStreamer video capture engine on Windows or
% Linux for free access to many codecs.
%
% Codecs supported by this demo on OS/X: 0 = Default, 1 = H.264, 2 = Apple Pixlet,
% 3 = MPEG-4, 4 = Component video, 5 = DV-PAL, 6 = DVCPRO-NTSC, 7 =
% DVCPRO-PAL, 8 = DVCPRO50-NTSC, 9 = DVCPRO50-PAL, 10 = H.263
%
% The supported codecs and settings for Linux and Windows with GStreamer
% can be found in the code and are explained in 'help VideoRecording'.
%
% Empirically, the MPEG-4 codec (codec=3) seems to provide a good tradeoff
% between quality, compression, speed and cpu load. It allows to reliably
% record drop-free sound and video with a resolution of 640x480 pixels at
% 30 frames per second. Quality is good enough for most purposes, and cpu
% load on a MacBookPro is only about 33% without preview and 50% with
% preview.
%
% H.264 has better quality and higher compression, but is able to nearly
% saturate a MacBookPro, so reliable recording at 30 fps may be difficult
% to achieve or needs more powerful machines.
%
% Some of the other codecs may provide the highest image quality and lowest
% cpu load, but they also produce huge files, e.g., all the DVxxx codecs
% for PAL and NTSC video capture, as well as the component video codecs.
%
% 'withsound' If set to non-zero, sound will be recorded as well. This is
% the default.
%
% 'showit' If non-zero, video will be shown onscreen during recording
% (default: Show it). Not showing the video during recording will
% significantly reduce system load, so this may help to sustain a skip free
% recording on lower end machines.
%
% 'windowed' If set to non-zero, show captured video in a window located at
% the top-left corner of the screen, instead of fullscreen. Windowed
% display is the default.
