function DriftDemoOSX
%
% OS X: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% Display an animated grating using the new Screen('DrawTexture') command.
% In the OS X Psychtoolbox Screen('DrawTexture') replaces
% Screen('CopyWindow').     
%
% CopyWindow vs. DrawTexture:
%
% In the OS 9 Psychtoolbox, Screen ('CopyWindow") was used for all
% time-critical display of images, in particular for display of the movie
% frames in animated stimuli. In contrast, Screen('DrawTexture') should not
% be used for display of all graphic elements,  but only for  display of
% MATLAB matrices.  For all other graphical elements, such as lines,  rectangles,
% and ovals we recommend that these be drawn directly to the  display
% window during the animation rather than rendered to offscreen  windows
% prior to the animation.
%
% OS 9 and WINDOWS : ______________________________________________________
%
% DriftDemoOSX does not exist on OS 9 and Windows.  See DriftDemo instead.

% HISTORY
%  6/28/04    awi     Adapted from Denis Pelli's DriftDemo.m for OS 9 
%  7/18/04    awi     Added Priority call.  Fixed.
%  9/8/04     awi     Added Try/Catch, cosmetic changes to comments and see also.
%  4/23/05    mk      Added Priority(0) in catch section, moved Screen('OpenWindow')
%                     before first call to Screen('MakeTexture') in
%                     preparation of future improvements to 'MakeTexture'.
