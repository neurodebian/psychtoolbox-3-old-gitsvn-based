function BasicSoundOutputDemo(repetitions, wavfilename)
% BasicSoundOutputDemo([repetitions=0][, wavfilename])
%
% Demonstrates very basic usage of the new Psychtoolbox sound output driver
% PsychPortAudio(). PsychPortAudio is a completely new sound output driver
% for Psychtoolbox, meant as a better, more reliable, more accurate
% replacement for the old Psychtoolbox SND() function and other means of
% sound output in Matlab like sound(), soundsc(), wavplay(), audioplayer()
% etc.
%
% PsychPortAudio is currently only available for OS/X on Intel based
% Macintosh computers and for Microsoft Windows. OS/X PowerPC and Linux
% will follow in the foreseeable future. The driver is in early beta stage,
% fine-tuning, testing and validation will take some time. If you need
% sound output, give it a try but don't be disappointed if it doesn't work
% perfect, instead report issues to the forum. We don't expect any trouble
% on OS/X, but given the huge variability on the Windows platform (and the
% low quality of many sound drivers on Windows), that may need some tweaking,
% so please provide feedback!
%
% This demo only demonstrates normal operation, not the low-latency mode,
% extra demos and tests for low-latency and high precision timing output will
% follow soon. If you need low-latency, make sure to read "help
% InitializePsychSound" carefully or contact the forum.
% Our preliminary testing for low-latency mode showed that sub-millisecond
% accurate sound onset and << 10 msecs latency are possible on OS/X and on
% some specially configured M$-Windows setups.
%
%
% Optional arguments:
%
% repetitions = Number of repetitions of the sound. Zero = Repeat forever
% (until stopped by keypress), 1 = Play once, 2 = Play twice, ....
%
% wavfilename = Name of a .wav sound file to load and playback. Otherwise
% the good ol' handel.mat file (part of Matlab) is used.
%
% The demo just loads and plays the soundfile, waits for a keypress to stop
% it, then quits.

pahandle = PsychPortAudio('Open', [], [], 0, freq, nrchannels);

% Fill the audio playback buffer with the audio data 'wavedata':
PsychPortAudio('FillBuffer', pahandle, wavedata);

% start it immediately (0) and wait for the playback to start, return onset
% timestamp.

    % Query current playback status and print it to the Matlab window:

% Stop playback:
PsychPortAudio('Stop', pahandle);

% Close the audio device:
