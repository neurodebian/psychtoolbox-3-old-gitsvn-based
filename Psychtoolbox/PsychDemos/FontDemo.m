function FontDemo% FontDemo shows how to get the font you want, when you're not% sure what's available, and only certain fonts will do.  This% is a portable solution to the problem of running on various% computers and Operating Systems that offer various fonts.%% In the FontDemo program we call CHAR to convert a one-string list,% e.g. {'Arial'}, to a string, e.g. 'Arial'.  The OS9 version of Screen% in fact does this automatically, and the Win version will too, but% that enhancement hasn't been implemented yet.%% 5/23/02	dgp   Wrote it.% 10/11/06	dhb   Turn off warnings, use max screen.try    % Removes the blue screen flash and minimize extraneous warnings.	Screen('Preference', 'VisualDebugLevel', 3);    Screen('Preference', 'SuppressAllWarnings', 1);        % Find out how many screens and use largest screen number.    whichScreen = max(Screen('Screens'));       % Open a new window.    window = Screen('OpenWindow', whichScreen);     fprintf('New window opened with font set to %s.\n', Screen('TextFont', window));        for font = {'Arial', 'Geneva', 'Helvetica', 'sans-serif'}        % Set font        Screen('TextFont', window, char(font));     % Win: currently needs the call to "char"                % Check if the screen's font has changed to the one we requested.        match = streq(font, Screen('TextFont', window));        if match            fprintf('Successfully set font to %s.\n', Screen('TextFont', window));            break;        end    end    if ~match        error('We couldn''t find any of the fonts we wanted.');        fprintf('The window font is %s.\n', Screen('TextFont', window));    end    Screen('Close', window);catch        Screen('CloseAll');    psychrethrow(lasterror);    end
