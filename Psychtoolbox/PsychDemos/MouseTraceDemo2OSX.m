% MouseTraceDemo2OSX
%
% OS X: ___________________________________________________________________
% 
% Draw a curve with the mouse. Same as MouseTraceDemoOSX, but asks
% Screen('Flip') to not clear the framebuffer after flip. This way,
% we don't need to redraw the whole mousetrace in each frame.
%
% The only prominent difference between MouseTraceDemoOSX and
% MouseTraceDemo is that MouseTraceDemoOSX uses a double-buffered display.
% For a complete description of changes made to convert MouseTraceDemo into
% MouseTraceDemoOSX edit this demo and read its history.

% HISTORY
% 8/12/97  dhb, wtf  Wrote it.
% 8/13/97  dhb			 Small modifications.
% 8/15/97  dgp			 Drag mouse instead of clicking before and after.
% 8/07/01  awi       Added font conditional, changed "button" to "buttons"
%                    and indexed the mouse button result for Windows.
% 4/11/01  awi		   Cosmetic editing of comments.
% 4/13/02  dgp       Use Arial, no need for conditional.
% 11/18/04 awi       Modified to make it work on OS X and renamed to MouseTraceDemoOSX.  
%                       - Changed the open command to specify double
%                       buffers and 32 depth because we don't yet support
%                       8-bit depth on OS X.  
%                       - Double buffer the display;  
%                        the path does not accumulate in the window so
%                        render the entire path on every frame, not just the
%                        path delta since the last segment was drawn.  
%                       - Added flip command because we are double
%                       buffered.
%                       - Added try..catch to close onscreen window in
%                       event of failure.  
%                       - Open on the highest-numbered display and pass
%                       GetMouse the window pointer.  Not necessary for OS
%                       X, but often desirable to use secondary display if
%                       available.
%                       
% 4/23/05  mk       Derived from MouseTraceDemoOSX: Uses new "Don't clear" mode of Flip.
%                   to avoid redrawing the whole past mousetrace after each
%                   Flip --> Faster.
