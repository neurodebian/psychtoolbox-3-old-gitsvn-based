function PsychtoolboxPostInstallRoutine(isUpdate, flavor)
% PsychtoolboxPostInstallRoutine(isUpdate [, flavor])
%
% Psychtoolbox post installation routine. You should not call this
% file directly! This routine is called by DownloadPsychtoolbox,
% or UpdatePsychtoolbox after a successfull download/update of
% Psychtoolbox. The routine performs tasks that are common to
% downloads and updates, so they can share their code/implementation.
%
% As PsychtoolboxPostInstallRoutine itself is downloaded or updated,
% it can contain code specific to each Psychtoolbox revision/release
% to perform special setup procedures for new features, to announce
% important info to the user, whatever...

% History:
% 23/06/2006 Written (MK). Has no real function yet, but soon...
