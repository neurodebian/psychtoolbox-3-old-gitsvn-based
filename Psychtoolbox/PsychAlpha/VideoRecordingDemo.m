function VideoRecordingDemo(moviename, codec, withsound, showit)
% VideoRecordingDemo(moviename [, codec] [, withsound] [, showit])
%
% Demonstrates simple video capture and recording to a Quicktime movie
% file. Only works on OS/X and Windows for now.
%
% Arguments and their meaning:
%
% 'moviename' name of output movie file. The file must not exist at start
% of recording.
%
% 'codec' a number, indicating the type of video codec you want to use.
% Defaults to "whatever the system default is", valid settings are between
% 0 and 9. Some codecs are very fast, i.e., high framerates and low system
% load, others provide high compression rates, i.e., small video files at
% good quality. Usually there's a tradeoff between encoding speed, quality
% and compression ratio, so you'll have to try out different ones to find
% one suitable for your purpose. Some codecs only work at specific
% framerates or for specific image sizes. If you set the level of verbosity
% of PTB to at least 4, it will print out a list of supported codecs on
% your system (Screen('Preference', 'Verbosity', 4)). Without
% Quicktime-Pro, you'll usually only have a very limited set of codecs
% available.
%
% Codecs supported by this demo: 0 = Default, 1 = H.264, 2 = Apple Pixlet,
% 3 = MPEG-4, 4 = Component video, 5 = DV-PAL, 6 = DVCPRO-NTSC, 7 =
% DVCPRO-PAL, 8 = DVCPRO50-NTSC, 9 = DVCPRO50-PAL.
%
% 'withsound' If set to non-zero, sound will be recorded as
% well (default: record sound).
%
%'showit' If non-zero, video will be shown onscreen during recording
% (default: Show it). Not showing the video during recording will
% significantly reduce system load, so this may help to sustain a skip free
% recording on lower end machines.
%
% This is early beta code, expect bugs and rough edges!

% History:
% 11.2.2007 Written (MK).
