% OSX: For serial port access under Mac OS X you may want to download COMM
% from the Mathworks web site. Written by Tom Davis. "This MEX-file
% provides Matlab access to Mac serial ports. This includes built-in ports 
% (modem and irDa) and add-on ports, such as USB-to-serial adapters. It has
% been tested with Mac OS X 10.3 and Matlab 6.5.1. The Xcode project used to
% develop the MEX-file is included."

% TCP/UDP/IP Toolbox 2.0.5
% This toolbox can be used to set up TCP/IP connections or send/receive 
% UDP/IP packets in Matlab. It can transmit data over the Intranet/Internet 
% between Matlab processes or other applications. It is possible to act as 
% server and/or client and transmit strings, arrays of any data type, 
% files, or Matlab variables. There's no mexmac file in this release, 
% but this toolbox works perfectly on Mac OS X as is. Tested with 
% Matlab 7.0.1 and Mac OS X 10.3.7. Just use the MEX command with the main 
% pnet.c file and it will generate a pnet.mexmac.
