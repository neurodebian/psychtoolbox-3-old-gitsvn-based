%
% This folder should contain the libraries and configuration files
% needed to build the BrightSideCore.dll from its source and to
% actually use the DLL to interface PTB to a BrightSide High Dynamic
% Range Display device. Upon load time, the BrightSideCore.dll will
% dynamically link against the libraries in this folder and read the
% configuration files needed for setting up the display.
%
% In a standard Psychtoolbox-3 installation, this folder won't contain
% any of the runtime and development libraries or headers, because we
% can not bundle them with PTB due to license restrictions.
%
% If you are the proud owner of such a display device, you will have
% a copy of the needed libraries and headers as part of the Software
% which is bundled with the display device. Just copy those runtime
% libraries and config files into this folder and you should be ready
% to use your display with PTB.

% Files:
% To be done.
