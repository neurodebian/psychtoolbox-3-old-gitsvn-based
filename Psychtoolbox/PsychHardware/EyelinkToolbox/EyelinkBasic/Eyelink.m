function EYELINK%% 	The EyelinkToolbox is a collection of m-files and a Mex file that%	can be used to control the SR research-Eyelink© gazetracker.% 	(http://www.eyelinkinfo.com/)% 	from within Matlab and in combination with the%	Psychophysics ToolBox (see: http://www.psychtoolbox.org/).%%   For a complete list of available functions type "EYELINK" in the Matlab command window%   For an explanation of any particular eyelink function just add a%   question mark "?" after a command.% 	E.g. for 'Initialize', try either of these equivalent forms:% 		EYELINK('Initialize?')% 		EYELINK initialize?%% 	[optional arguments]:% 	Brackets in the function list, e.g. [remport], indicate optional arguments, not% 	matrices. Optional arguments must be in order, without omitting earlier ones.%	%	If you need examples to get you started, check out the EyelinkDemos folder.%		%   EYELINK is a MEX file, which can be used as an interface between the eyelink%   and matlab. The EyelinkToolbox uses the same approach as the SCREEN mex function%	provided in the PsychToolBox  and also uses the functions provided by this%	toolbox for doing any graphics involved.%%	Disclaimer: we cannot be hold responsible for any damage that may (appear to) be%				caused by the use of this toolbox.
