function [pol] = LinearToPolar(cal,linear)% [pol] = LinearToPolar(cal,[linear])%% Converts from linear rectangular coordinates to polar% coordinates.%% Polar coordinates are defined as radius, azimuth, and elevation.%% LinearToPolar has been renamed "SensorToPolar".  The old% name, "LinearToPolar", is still provided for compatability % with existing scripts but will disappear from future releases % of the Psychtoolbox.  Please use SensorToPolar instead.%% See Also: PsychCal, PsychCalObsolete, SensorToPolar% 9/9/93			jms		It didn't work for matrix inputs, because a %										matrix '^' needed to be a by-element '.^'% 9/26/93			dhb   Added calData argument.% 2/6/94			jms   Changed 'polar' to 'pol'% 2/20/94			jms   Added single argument case to avoid cData% 4/6/96			dhb		Fixed bug noted by ccc.
