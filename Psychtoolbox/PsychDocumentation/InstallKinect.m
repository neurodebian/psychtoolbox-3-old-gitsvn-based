% InstallKinect - Kinect driver installation instructions.
%
% MS-Windows:
%
% 1. Unzip the file Psychtoolbox/PsychContributed/Kinect-v16-WindowsDrivers.zip
%    into a temporary folder, e.g., C:\tmp\KinectDrivers.
%
% 2. Plug in your Kinect box into a USB port via the interface cable.
%
% 3. The Windows hardware setup assistant will start, tell you about new
%    detected hardware and ask you for drivers. Say "No" to the
%    "automatically search for drivers" option, but select to "provide your
%    own drivers". In the next tab, select "browse for drivers", and then
%    select the temporary folder with the unzipped file (from step 1) as
%    driver folder. Press ok.
%
% 4. The driver will be installed from the zip file, the device manager
%    will notifiy you of the new device, then prompt you for installation
%    of another device. Repeat the same procedure from step 3 until no more
%    devices need to be installed. This procedure will repeat three to four
%    times until all drivers are installed, as the Kinect shows up as
%    multiple separate devices (Video camera, Audio soundcard and
%    Kinect motor).
%
% 5. The setup assistant will tell you that your new device is fully
%    operational. Quit the assistant.
%
% 6. Unplug the Kinect, wait a few seconds, plug it in again, just to be
%    sure it is correctly detected.
%
% 7. Now you can start Matlab or Octave and use the Kinect! Try KinectDemo
%    and Kinect3DDemo for a start, then delve into your own Kinect adventures.
%
% The current Kinect low level drivers are still early prototypes, so
% expect occassional bugs or weird behaviour.
%
%
% GNU/Linux:
%
% If you use the Psychtoolbox distribution provided by the NeuroDebian
% project (http://neuro.debian.net) there's nothing to do. It should "just
% work(tm)", well almost: Skip to step 2. Otherwise the following step 1
% is required:
%
% 1. If you have Ubuntu Linux 10.04 LTS or later installed, open a terminal
% window and type this sequence of commands, providing your administrator
% password as requested.
%
%    a) sudo add-apt-repository ppa:arne-alamut/freenect
%    b) sudo apt-get update
%    c) sudo apt-get install libfreenect
%    d) sudo adduser YOURNAME video
%       --> (YOURNAME) is your user login name!
%    e) Log out and Log in again.
%
% 2. Kinect is now useable from within Matlab or Octave. Well almost.
% Systems with Linux kernel version 3.0 or later can use the video camera
% and microphones of the Kinect as regular sound and video devices, e.g.,
% for use by the Psychtoolbox videocapture and recording functions or other
% video apps (Skype, etc.). This however blocks use of the Kinect by our
% PsychKinect() driver. If you want the Kinect as 3D depths camera with
% our driver or other Kinect-specific software, you need to disable the
% standard Linux kinect driver "gspca_kinect" by black-listing it. On
% Ubuntu Linux (and probably most other distributions) you can do this
% by copying the file linux_blacklist_kinectvideo from Psychtoolboxs
% PsychContributed folder to Linux /etc/modprobe.d/ directory as a root
% user. This is most simply done by executing this function InstallKinect,
% and blindly entering your password while logged in as a user with
% administrator rights (as the script calls the sudo command).
%
% 3. After this procedure, the Kinect should be fully useable by Psychtoolbox.
%
%
% CAVEAT:
%
% This is still early prototype software, expect bugs, bumps and hickups.
