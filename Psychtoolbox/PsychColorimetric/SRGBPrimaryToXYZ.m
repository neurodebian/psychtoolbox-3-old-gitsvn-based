function XYZ = SRGBPrimaryToXYZ(rgb)% XYZ = SRGBPrimaryToXYZ(rgb)%% Convert between sRGB primaries and CIE XYZ.% The rgb are linear device% coordinates for the primaries of the sRGB% standard.  One would expect these to be in% the range 0-1, although any scaling will simply% propogate through to the XYZ coordinates.%% Conversion matrix as speciedi at:% http://www.srgb.com/basicsofsrgb.htm%% 5/1/04	dhb				Wrote it.M = [3.2406 -1.5372 -0.4986 ; -0.9689 1.8758 0.0415 ; 0.0557 -0.2040 1.0570];XYZ = inv(M)*rgb;
