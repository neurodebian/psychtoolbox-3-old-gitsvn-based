function AudioFeedbackLatencyTest(trigger, nrtrials, freq, freqout, fullduplex)
% AudioFeedbackLatencyTest([trigger=0.1] [, nrtrials=10] [, freq=44100][, freqout=44100])
%
% Tries to test sound onset accuracy of PsychPortAudio without need for
% external measurement equipment: Sound signals are played back via
% PsychPortAudio at well defined points in time, using low-latency mode. At
% the same time, sound is captured via PsychPortAudio's capture facilities.
% The idea is that the microphone or line-in connector should pick up and
% capture the sound signals emitted through line-out (via a line-out ->
% line-in feedback cable) or emitted through the speakers. We measure and
% compare timing of emitted vs. captured sound spikes.
%
% Results on MacbookPro suggest that the method works, but with a not 100%
% accuracy, so its still better to use external measurement equipment to
% test!!!
%
% EARLY BETA CODE: DON'T USE OR USE WITH GREAT CAUTION!
%
% Optional parameters:
% 'trigger' = Trigger level for detection of sound onset in captured sound.
%
% 'ntrials' = Number of measurement trials to perform.
%
% 'freq' = Samplerate of capture device.
%
% 'freqout' = Samplerate of playback device.
%
% Obviously this test function can only be used in a very silent room!
