function PerceptualVBLSyncTest(stereomode, fullscreen, doublebuffer)
% PerceptualVBLSyncTest(stereomode, fullscreen, doublebuffer)
%
% Perceptual synchronization test for synchronization of Screen('Flip') and
% Screen('WaitBlanking') to the vertical retrace.
%
% After starting this test, you should see a flickering greyish background
% that flickers in a homogenous way - without cracks or weird moving patterns
% in the flickering area. If you see an imhogenous flicker, this means that
% synchronization of stimulus onset to the vertical retrace doesn't work due
% to some serious bug or limitation of your graphics hardware or its driver.
% If you don't know what this means, you can test this script with parameter
% doublebuffer == 0 to artificially create a synchronization failure.
%
% On OS-X you should also see some emerging pattern of yellow horizontal lines.
% These lines should be tightly concentrated/clustered in the topmost area of
% the screen. Lots of yellow lines in the middle or bottom area or even
% randomly distributed lines indicate some bug in the driver of your graphics
% hardware. This is a common problem of all ATI graphics adapters on MacOS-X
% versions earlier than OS-X 10.4.3 when running a dual-display setup...
%
% A second reason for distributed yellow lines could be bad timing on your
% machine, e.g., due to background activity by virus scanners or the Spotlight
% indexing service on OS-X. Turn these off for conducting your studies!
%

% History:
% 01/28/06 mk Written. Replaces the built-in flickertest of Screen('OpenWindow')
%             on multi-display setups. That test wasn't well received :(

% Check for presence of OpenGL PTB.
