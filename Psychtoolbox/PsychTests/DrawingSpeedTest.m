function DrawingSpeedTest(n)
% DrawingSpeedTest([n])
%
% Tests batch-drawing performance of some Screen functions. Batch drawing
% is a way to submit multiple primitives, e.g., Filled Rects, at once. This
% way the Matlab call overhead and some internal setup overhead is saved
% and drawing should be significantly faster than when issuing single
% drawing commands in a loop.
%
% This currently only tests filled rects. Dots and Lines are nicely
% demonstrated by DotDemo and LinesDemo.
%
% The optional parameter n allows to specifiy the number of primitives to
% draw each frame, default is 800.

% History:
% 04/30/07 mk Wrote it.

% Generate a matrix which specs n filled rectangles, with randomized
% position:

    posx = rand * w;
    posy = rand * h;
    colors(j, 1:3) = [ rand * 255, rand * 255, rand * 255];

end

% Initially sync us to retrace, take start time t1:
t1 = Screen('Flip', win);

% Timing loop, 1000 trials:
for i=1:1000
    % Batch draw:
    Screen('FillRect', win, colors', transpose(myrect(:,:)));
    % Flip it. Don't clear buffers, don't sync to retrace. We want the raw
    % speed, nothing limited by monitor refresh:
    Screen('Flip', win, 0, 2, 2);
end

% Make sure the GPU is idle:
glFinish;

% Take end time, compute and print the stats:
telapsed = Screen('Flip', win) - t1;
tavg = telapsed
tperrect = tavg / n
