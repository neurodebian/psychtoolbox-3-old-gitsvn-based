Functions listed in this file will not have interfaces automatically generated by autocode.m.

(The file is searched using grep, so functions whose names appear anywhere in the file will be skipped.)

- these have character pointer return arguments that should be used to generate MATLAB strings
glGetString			- implemented manually
gluErrorString			- implemented manually
gluGetString			- implemented manually

- these use double indirection, which is rare enough in OpenGL that autocode.m doesn't handle it
glGetBufferPointerv		- implemented manually
glGetPointerv			- implemented manually
glGetVertexAttribPointerv	- implemented manually
glShaderSource          - special interface implemented manually
glMultiDrawElements		- need alternate interface to this function, as it
            			  involves arrays of pointers, whereas we normally don't have
				          access to pointers to a matrix's data in MATLAB

- these involve C callback functions
gluNurbsCallback
gluNurbsCallbackData
gluNurbsCallbackDataEXT
gluQuadricCallback
gluTessCallback
gluNewTess
gluDeleteTess
gluTessBeginContour
gluTessBeginPolygon
gluTessEndContour
gluTessEndPolygon
gluTessNormal
gluTessProperty
gluTessVertex
gluBeginPolygon
gluEndPolygon
gluNextContour

- these are not defined yet in the GLEW library - need to manually implement interface
glSamplePass        - implemented manually

- these need our special malloc(),calloc(),free() buffer management to work on Matlab & Octave:
glFeedbackBuffer    - implemented manually
glSelectBuffer      - implemented manually

- these needed some patches (therefore stored in gl_manual.c) to allow their use with VBOs and PBOs and special pointer magic

glColorPointer
glDrawElements
glDrawRangeElements
