function callStack = AssertMex(varargin)
% Handle missing or dysfunctional MEX files on Matlab or Octave.
%
% AssertMex(targetname)
%
% AssertMex detects missing mex files.  Calling AssertMex from
% your help file, e.g. foo.m, asserts the existence of a mex file foo.mex.
% If no such mex file exists then AssertMex will exit with an error.
%
% Assert Mex is useful for detecting the error condition when a .m help
% file is mistakenly executed because the correspondig .mex file is
% missing. When foo.mex is missing, MATLAB silently executes the help file
% foo.m instead.  Calling AssertMex within foo.m detects and reports that
% error. E.g., in Screen.m you'll find AssertMex('Screen.m') to handle
% missing or dysfunctional Screen mex files properly.

% HISTORY:
%  
% mm/dd/yy
%   
% 12/14/03  awi     Wrote it
% 07/02/04  awi     Improved documentation: Added See also, explained
%                   behavior when no arguments are supplied.
%                   Changed name to AssertMex from PsychAssertMex
% 10/03/04  awi     Modified to accept 'WINDOWS', 'OS9', 'OSX'
% 01/08/05  fwc     fixed little bug, see comments
% 01/11/05  awi     Merged fwc fix into psychtoolbox.org master copy.      
% 01/29/05  dgp     Cosmetic.
% 03/07/05  fwc     Fixed bugs due to which failed Assertmex to accept 'OSX', 'OS9' as valid input.
%					In line 80/81 badNames was often {''} which is not empty for isempty().
%					Also changed || into | in line 90
% 03/08/05  dgp     Add support for 'WIN'.
% 10/06/05	awi     Fixed bug: Changed "okSupNameMatches"  to match addition of  'WIN' to 
%								to "okSupNames"
% 3/3/06    awi     Rewrote help for improved clarity.
% 6/13/09    mk     Update to handle execution failures and missing files
%                   on Octave-3.2 et al. as well.
