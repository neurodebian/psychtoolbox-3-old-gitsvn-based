% AssertMex([platform1,] [platform2,] ...)
%
% OSX and OS9: _____________________________________________________________
%
% AssertMex is used to detect missing mex files.  Calling AssertMex from
% your program, say foo.m, asserts the existence of a mex file, e.g.
% foo.mex, with the same name as the function from which AssertMex is
% invoked.  If no such mex file exists AssertMex will exit with an error. 
% If no argument is supplied then AssertMex will issue an error on any
% platform on which it cannot find a mex file.  If any platform names are
% supplied then AssertMex will issue errors only if MATLAB fails to find
% the mex file on the named platforms.
%
% If one tries to call a missing mex file, e.g. foo.mex, MATLAB instead 
% executes the corresponding .m help file, foo.m, leading to mysterious failures. 
% To avoid that problem, use AssertMex within your help or platform-specific 
% .m file to safely detect that a mex file is missing. 
% 
% AssertMex makes sure that the script that invoked it is not running on
% any of the platforms named. MATLAB should have found a .mex file with
% the same name and executed that instead of the script that invoked
% AssertMex.  If a violation is found, AssertMex will exit with an error.
% 
% AssertMex accepts platform names as returned by Matlab's COMPUTER
% command:
% 'PCWIN', 'SOL2', 'HPUX', 'HP700', 'ALPHA', 'IBM_RS', 'SGI', 'LNX86',
% 'MAC', 'MAC2'
%
% NOTE: Counterintuitively, "MAC2" refers to OS9 and "MAC" refers to OSX.
%
% AssertMex also accepts these synonyms in place of MATLAB's names:
%  'OSX', 'OS9', and 'Windows'
%
% WIN: ________________________________________________________________
% 
% AssertMex does not yet exist in Windows.

% HISTORY:
%  
% mm/dd/yy
%   
% 12/14/03  awi     Wrote it
% 07/02/04  awi     Improved documentation: Added See also, explained
%                   behavior when no arguments are supplied.
%                   Changed name to AssertMex from PsychAssertMex
% 10/03/04  awi     Modified to accept 'WINDOWS', 'OS9', 'OSX'
% 01/08/05  fwc     fixed little bug, see comments
% 01/11/05  awi     Merged fwc fix into psychtoolbox.org master copy.      
% 01/29/05  dgp     Cosmetic.
% 03/07/05  fwc     Fixed bugs due to which failed Assertmex to accept 'OSX', 'OS9' as valid input.
%					In line 80/81 badNames was often {''} which is not empty for isempty().
%					Also changed || into | in line 90
% 03/08/05  dgp     Add support for 'WIN'.
% 10/06/05	awi     Fixed bug: Changed "okSupNameMatches"  to match addition of  'WIN' to 
%								to "okSupNames"

% Do not do anything on Octave build.
