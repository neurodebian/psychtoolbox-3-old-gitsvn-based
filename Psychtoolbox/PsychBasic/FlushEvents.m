% Windows, Linux, OS-X under Matlab with Java enabled: ____________________
%
% FlushEvents will accept all arguments, but only 'keyDown' (or no
% argument at all) removes keypress events. Events other than keypress
% events are not supported.

% Octave or Matlab in -nojvm mode under Linux and OS-X: ___________________

% under Matlab running in -nojvm mode, except for the Microsoft Windows

% 3/25/97  dgp	Wrote it.
% 9/20/05  awi  Added AssertMex call for OS 9 and Win and added OS X
%                   conditional.
% 1/22/06  awi  Commented out Cocoa wrapper and wrote Java wrapper.
% 6/20/06  awi  Use AddPsychJavaPath instead of AssertGetCharJava.
% 8/16/06  cgb  Now using the new GetChar system.
% 9/18/06  mk   FlushEvents now works on all Matlabs (OS-X, Windows) in JVM
%               mode. In -nojvm mode on Windows, it falls back to the old
%               Windows FlushEvents.dll ...
%               We now check for valid event descriptors.
%
% 11/14/06 mk   Ugly while CharAvail, GetChar; hack to fix more GetChar brain-damage.
% 09/21/07 mk   Added a drawnow() on top to prevent Matlabs GUI from
%               receiving mouse clicks that were meant to be only processed by the
%               experiment script. In other words: Fix more Matlab
