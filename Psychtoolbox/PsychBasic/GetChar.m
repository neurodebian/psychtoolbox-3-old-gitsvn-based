function [ch,when] = GetChar
% [ch,when] = GetChar
% 
% Wait for a typed character and return it.  If a character was typed
% before calling GetChar then GetChar will return immediatly.  Characters
% typed into the MATLAB command line while no function is executing,  typed
% into the editor window, or flushed by FlushEvents are all ignored by
% GetChar.
% 
% "when" is a struct. It returns the time of the keypress, the "adb"
% address of the input device, and the state of all the modifier keys
% (shift, control, command, option, alphaLock) and the mouse button. If you
% have multiple keyboards connected, "address" may allow you to distinguish
% which is responsible for the key press. "when.ticks" is the value of
% GetTicks when the key was pressed. "when.secs" is an estimate, based on
% when.ticks, of what GetSecs would have been. Since it's derived from a
% tick count, it's coarsely quantized in steps of 1/60.15 s. If you plan to
% use the value of when.secs then you should make sure that the
% Psychtoolbox has a fresh estimate of tick0secs by calling
% Screen('Preference','Tick0Secs',nan).
% 
% GetChar and CharAvail are character-oriented (and slow), whereas KbCheck
% and KbWait are keypress-oriented (and fast). If only a meta key (like
% <option> or <shift>) was hit, KbCheck will return true, because a key was
% pressed, but CharAvail will return false, because no character was
% generated. See KbCheck.
% 
% CharAvail and GetChar use the Event Manager to retrieve the character
% generated, not the raw key press(es) per se. If the user presses "a",
% GetChar returns 'a', but if the user presses option-e followed by "a",
% this selects an accented a, "‡", which is treated by GetChar as a single
% character, even though it took the user three keypresses (counting the
% option key) to produce it.
% 
% CharAvail and GetChar call the Event Manager, which allows the system to
% get control. Sometimes CharAvail will take tens of milliseconds to
% return, so don't use CharAvail in real-time loops. And there can be some
% delay between when the key is pressed and when CharAvail or GetChar
% detects it. If precise timing of the keypress is important, use KbCheck
% or KbWait.
%
% OS X: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% KEYSTROKES IN THE BACKGROUND: Under OS 9, keyboard input is automatically
% directed to the Getchar queue while a script or function executes in
% MATLAB.  Therefore, your script may do work and then call GetChar to read
% keys pressed while the script worked.  OS X is the same, except that, to
% detect keypresses made before the GetChar call, you must have called
% "ListenChar" earlier.  ListenChar redirects keystrokes to the GetChar
% queue. Calling ListenChar at the begining of your OS X script should
% cause GetChar to behave identically to OS 9 GetChar with respect to
% background keystroke collection.  Note that clicking on a MATLAB window
% assigns it key focus, redirecting keyboard input away from the GetChar
% queue and to the MATLAB window, undoing ListenChar.  
%
% TIMESTAMPS: The "when" return argument contains both "ticks" and "secs"
% fields recording the times of keystrokes in units of Carbon system ticks
% and seconds, respectively.  While OS 9 GetChar returns the same fields,
% there are differences in precision between OS 9 and OS X values.  The OS
% 9 operating system timestamps events in units of system ticks, with a
% precision no better than 1/60.15 second.  GetChar converts ticks to
% seconds, which yields a product of only GetTicks, not GetSecs precision.
% The OS X operating system timestamps events in units of seconds with the
% much higer precision of GetSecs. That precision, typically microseconds
% or better, depends on hardware.  (Call "GetSecsTick" to find the
% precision of GetSecs on your system.) On OS X, the precision of GetChar
% timestamps might be limited by the USB keyboard, usually no better than
% 10ms.
%
% UNICODE CHARACTERS: Some keyboard keys, such as the function keys,
% return unicode characters outside of the 8-bit UTF-8 range.  MATLAB can
% not correctly display these characters.  For unicode keys which MATLAB
% can not display, GetChar returns the numeric unicode value of the
% character.  
%
% OTHER "when" RETURN ARGUMENT FIELDS: Owing to differences in what
% accessory information the underlying operating systems provides about
% keystrokes, "when' return argument fields differ sbetween OS 9 and OS X.
%
% KNOWN BUGS:
%
% GetChar does not exit on ctrl-c or command-period.
%
% Using the MATLAB file editor prior to calling GetChar sometimes causes
% MATLAB to hang when GetChar is called.  Operating in the command window
% alone prior to calling GetChar does not seem to cause problems.  
% 
%
% OS 9: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% Command-Period always causes an immediate exit.
% When BACKGROUNDING is enabled, Matlab removes all characters from the
% event queue before executing each Matlab statement, so CharAvail and
% EventAvail('keyDown') always report 0. So turn off BACKGROUNDING:
% 	Screen('Preference','Backgrounding',0);
