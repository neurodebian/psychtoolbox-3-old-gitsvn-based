% BeampositionQueries -- What they are used for, and what can go wrong.

%

% MacOS-X provides a mechanism that allows to query the scanline which

% is currently updated by the scanning beam of a CRT display or by

% the equivalent mechanism in a video beamer or flat panel display,

% the so called "beamposition".

%

% We use this mechanism for two purposes:

%

% 1. Independent measurement of the monitor refresh interval: Psychtoolbox

% executes a measurement loop during Screen('OpenWindow') where it determines

% the monitor refresh interval. It takes a timestamp whenever the beamposition

% resets to zero at the start of a new display refresh cycle. The difference

% between consecutive timestamps is a sample of refresh duration. The samples

% of 50 consecutive refresh cycles are averaged. The "length" of the VBL

% is also computed as the difference between screen height (e.g., 1024 at a

% display resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels) and the highest scanline value

% encountered during the 50 refresh cycles.

%

% This measurement is used to cross-check the results of the synchronization tests

% (see 'help SyncTrouble') and the value provided by the operating system to 

% make the sync tests and display calibration as robust as possible, even

% if the operating system reports bogus values like 0 Hz, which can happen

% on MacOS-X.

%

% 2. Highly accurate and robust stimulus onset timestamps in Screen('Flip').

%

% In normal operation, the Screen('Flip') command, after issuing a buffer-swap

% request to the gfx-hardware, pauses execution until the operating system

% signals swap-completion in sync with vertical retrace. Then it takes a high-

% precision system timestamp. Due to the scheduling jitter present in any

% operating system, sometimes the execution of Psychtoolbox is resumed only after

% some random multi-millisecond delay has passed after buffer-swap, so the

% stimulus onset timestamp can be possibly off by multiple milliseconds from

% the real stimulus onset time. This is unwanted timing noise, especially if

% the time stamp is to be used for either computing stimulus onset time for

% future stimuli, or for synchronizing Psychtoolbox execution with other

% stimulus generators or acquisition hardware.

%

% On Microsoft Windows, there is currently nothing we can do about this - the

% price that people pay for running the worst operating system designed ever.

% The only "solution" would be to write special proprietary kernel mode drivers

% that implement a mechanism like on MacOS-X -- this would be time consuming and

% extremely painful, given the "openness" of Microsoft Windows.

%

% On GNU/Linux, timing precision even in non-realtime scheduling mode is far

% superior to all other operating systems, yielding a timing jitter of less

% than 100 microseconds under normal operating conditions. For special needs,

% there exist multiple methods of improving timing down to microsecond level,

% although some of time require some advanced programming skills.

%

% On MacOS-X, whose timing accuracy is somewhere between Linux and Windows,

% and luckily closer to Linux timing than to Windows timing, we use beamposition

% queries to improve accuracy of our timestamps:

%

% When taking the system timestamp, we also query the current rasterbeam position.

% From the known height of the display (in scanlines, including height of VBL),

% and the known refresh interval of our display, we can translate the current

% beam position into "elapsed time since start of VBL == elapsed time since

% double buffer swap". By subtracting this elapsed time value from our system

% timestamp, we get a corrected timestamp - the real system time of double buffer

% swap == start of VBL == aka stimulus onset. This allows for very accurate timestamps,

% despite possible non-deterministic multi-millisecond timing jitter. Psychtoolbox

% goes through great pains during startup to double-check that all required

% calibration values and mechanisms are accurate and work properly. You can assess

% the accuracy of all returned timestamps by use of the script VBLSyncTest.

%

% In case that beamposition queries should not work properly,

% PTB will use the same fallback strategy as on Linux and Windows: Just acquire

% a timestamp and live with the reduced accuracy and robustness.

% If the beampos query test fails, you will see some warning message about

% "SYNCHRONIZATION TROUBLE" in the Matlab/Octave command window.

%

% There are two possible causes for failure:

%

% 1. System overload: Too many other applications are running in parallel to

% Psychtoolbox, introducing severe timing noise into the calibration and test loop.

% See 'help SyncTrouble' on what to do.

%

% 2. Driver bug: Not much you can do, except submit a bug report to Apple for

% your specific hardware + software setup.
