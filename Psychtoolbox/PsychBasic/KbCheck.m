function [keyIsDown,secs, keyCode] = KbCheck(deviceNumber)
% [keyIsDown,secs,keyCode] = KbCheck([deviceNumber])
% 
% Return keyboard status (keyIsDown), time (secs) of the status check, and
% keyboard scan code (keyCode).
% 
%    keyIsDown      1 if any key, including modifiers such as <shift>,
%                   <control> or <caps lock> is down. 0 otherwise.
% 
%    secs           time of keypress as returned by GetSecs.
% 
%    keyCode        OS9 & OSX: a 128-element logical array.  Each bit
%                   within the logical array represents one keyboard key. 
%                   If a key is pressed, its bit is set, othewise the bit 
%                   is clear. To convert a keyCode to a vector of key  
%                   numbers use FIND(keyCode). To find a key's keyNumber 
%                   use KbName or KbDemo.
% 
%                   WIN: a 256-element array. It seems that the first 
%                   128 elements correspond to the ascii sequence of the 
%                   characters, and may be consistent with the Mac key codes.
%
% KbCheck and KbWait determine whether any key is down now, including the
% meta keys: <caps lock>, <shift>, <command>, <control>, and <option>. The
% only key not reported is the start key (triangle) used to power on your
% computer.
% 
% GetChar and CharAvail are character-oriented (and slow), whereas KbCheck
% and KbWait are keypress-oriented (and fast). If only a meta key was hit,
% KbCheck will return true, because a key was pressed, but CharAvail will
% return false, because no character was generated. See GetChar.
% 
% KbCheck and KbWait are MEX files, which take time to load when they're
% first called. They'll then stay loaded until you flush them (e.g. by
% changing directory or calling CLEAR MEX).
%
% OSX: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% KbCheck uses the PsychHID function, a general purpose function for
% reading from the Human Interface Device (HID) class of USB devices.
% 
% OS9: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% Command-Period causes an immediate exit.
%
% The Mac OS Event Manager detects and queues typed characters in the 
% background. GetChar will return any characters typed before the  call to
% GetChar. FlushEvents can be used to clear the character event  buffer
% read by GetChar. Unlike GetChar, KbCheck only reports keys  depressed at
% the moment KbCheck is called.  FlushEvents has no effect  on KbCheck.
% 
% Hitting CapsLock makes KbCheck and KbWait think that you're holding the
% shift key down. They will continue to think so (returning 1) until you
% release the shift by hitting CapsLock again.
%
% KbCheck and KbWait detect that a key is down by using the low-level Mac
% OS call GetKeys. It's not clear what temporal accuracy this provides, but
% it's much better than going through the higher-level Event Manager. Our
% impression from reading the documentation in Dan Costin's KeMo package
% web http://psychtoolbox.org/kemo.html
% <ftp://ftp.stolaf.edu/pub/macpsych/KemMo_1.5.sit.hqx> is that this
% low-level call still has uncertainty on the order of 11 ms because of the
% way the Mac OS polls ADB devices. Someone clever could probably use his
% advice to develop MEX files that timed keypresses more  accurately than
% KbCheck does.

% TO DO:
%
%  - Mention that on USB systems there the USB bus is sampled at 100 Hz.
%  - We could augment this to to accept an optional keyboard device number.
