function [keyIsDown,secs, keyCode] = KbCheck(deviceNumber)
% [keyIsDown, secs, keyCode] = KbCheck([deviceNumber])
% 
% Return keyboard status (keyIsDown), time (secs) of the status check, and
% keyboard scan code (keyCode).
% 
%    keyIsDown      1 if any key, including modifiers such as <shift>,
%                   <control> or <caps lock> is down. 0 otherwise.
% 
%    secs           time of keypress as returned by GetSecs.
% 
%    keyCode        A 256-element logical array.  Each bit
%                   within the logical array represents one keyboard key. 
%                   If a key is pressed, its bit is set, othewise the bit 
%                   is clear. To convert a keyCode to a vector of key  
%                   numbers use FIND(keyCode). To find a key's keyNumber 
%                   use KbName or KbDemo.
% 
% KbCheck and KbWait determine whether any key is down now, including the
% meta keys: <caps lock>, <shift>, <command>, <control>, and <option>. The
% only key not reported is the start key (triangle) used to power on your
% computer.
% 
% Some users of Laptops experienced the problem of "stuck keys": Some keys
% are always reported as "down", so KbWait returns immediately and KbCheck
% always reports keyIsDown == 1. This is often due to special function keys.
% These keys or system functionality are assigned vendor specific
% key codes, e.g., the status of the Laptop lid (opened/closed) could be
% reported by some special keycode. Whenever the Laptop lid is open, this key
% will be reported as pressed. You can work around this problem by passing
% a list of keycodes to be ignored by KbCheck and KbWait. See
% "help DisableKeysForKbCheck" on how to do this.
%
% Keys pressed by the subject often show up in the Matlab command window as
% well, cluttering that window with useless character junk. You can prevent
% this from happening by disabling keyboard input to Matlab: Add a
% ListenChar(2); command at the beginning of your script and a
% ListenChar(0); to the end of your script to enable/disable transmission of
% keypresses to Matlab. If your script should abort and your keyboard is
% dead, press CTRL+C to reenable keyboard input -- It is the same as
% ListenChar(0). See 'help ListenChar' for more info.
%
% GetChar and CharAvail are character-oriented (and slow), whereas KbCheck
% and KbWait are keypress-oriented (and fast). If only a meta key was hit,
% KbCheck will return true, because a key was pressed, but CharAvail will
% return false, because no character was generated. See GetChar.
% 
% KbCheck and KbWait are MEX files, which take time to load when they're
% first called. They'll then stay loaded until you flush them (e.g. by
% changing directory or calling CLEAR MEX).
%
% OSX: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% KbCheck uses the PsychHID function, a general purpose function for
% reading from the Human Interface Device (HID) class of USB devices.
%
% KbCheck queries the first USB-HID keyboard device by default. Optionally
% you can pass in a 'deviceNumber' to query a different keyboard if multiple
% keyboards are connected to your machine.
% 
% Windows/Linux: __________________________________________________________
%
% KbCheck uses built-in helper functions of the Screen() mex file to query
% keyboard state.

% TO DO:
%
%  - Mention that on USB systems there the USB bus is sampled at 100 Hz.
%  - We could augment this to to accept an optional keyboard device number.

% ptb_kbcheck_disabledKeys is a vector of keyboard scancodes. It allows
% to define keys which should never be reported as 'down', i.e. disabled
% keys. The vector is empty by default. If you have special quirky hardware,
% e.g., some Laptop keyboards, that reports some keys as 'always down', you
% can work around this 'stuck keys' by defining them in the ptb_kbcheck_disabledKeys
% vector.
global ptb_kbcheck_disabledKeys;
