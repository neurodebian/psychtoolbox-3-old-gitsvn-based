function [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)
% [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse([windowPtrOrScreenNumber])
%
% Returns the current (x,y) position of the cursor and the up/down state
% of the mouse buttons. "buttons" is a 1xN matrix where N is the number of
% mouse buttons. Each element of the matrix represents one mouse button.
% The element is true (1) if the corresponding mouse button is pressed and
% false (0) otherwise. 
%
% % Test if any mouse button is pressed. 
% if any(buttons)
%   fprintf('Someone''s pressing a button.\n');
% end
% 
% % Test if the first mouse button is pressed.
% if buttons(1)
%   fprintf('Someone''s pressing the first button!\n');
% end
%
% % Test if the second mouse button is pressed.
% if length(buttons)>=2 & buttons(2)
%   fprintf('Someone''s pressing the second button!\n');
% end
%
% length(buttons) tells you how many buttons there are on your mouse.
%
% The cursor position (x,y) is "local", i.e. relative to the origin of
% the window or screen, if supplied. Otherwise it's "global", i.e. relative
% to the origin of the main screen (the one with the menu bar).
% 
% NOTE: If you use GetMouse to wait for clicks, don't forget to wait
% for the user to release the mouse button, ending the current click, before
% you begin waiting for the next mouse press.
%

% Alternatively, you can also use the GetClicks() function to wait for

% mouse-clicks and return the mouse position of first click and the number

% of mouse button clicks.

%
% fprintf('Please click the mouse now.\n');
% [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% while any(buttons) % if already down, wait for release
% 	[x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% end
% while ~any(buttons) % wait for press
% 	[x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% end
% while any(buttons) % wait for release
% 	[x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% end
% fprintf('You clicked! Thanks.\n');
% 
% NOTE: GetMouse no longer supports this obsolete usage:
% xy = GetMouse([windowPtrOrScreenNumber])
% where xy is a 1x2 vector containing the x, y coordinates.
%
% OS X: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% Even if your mouse has more than three buttons, GetMouse will return as
% many values as your mouse has buttons, 
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
%
% M$-Windows: _____________________________________________________________
%
% Limitations:

%

% GetMouse will always assume a three button mouse and therefore always 

% return the state of three buttons. GetMouse will only report button state

% while at least one onscreen window is opened. This is the case in normal

% use, but it will fail to report button state if used as part of a Matlab

% script that doesn't open an onscreen window. GetMouse may get confused

% if you keep mouse buttons pressed down during the very first Screen('OpenWindow')

% call, i.e. press down the mouse button before window appears and keep it

% pressed after it appears. It will also fail to register that you release

% mouse buttons if you keep the button pressed during calls to Screen('Close')

% or Screen('CloseAll').
