% [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse([windowPtrOrScreenNumber])
%
% Returns the current (x,y) position of the cursor and the up/down state
% of the mouse buttons. "buttons" is a 1xN matrix where N is the number of
% mouse buttons. Each element of the matrix represents one mouse button.
% The element is true (1) if the corresponding mouse button is pressed and
% false (0) otherwise. 
%
% % Test if any mouse button is pressed. 
% if any(buttons)
%   fprintf('Someone''s pressing a button.\n');
% end
% 
% % Test if the first mouse button is pressed.
% if buttons(1)
%   fprintf('Someone''s pressing the first button!\n');
% end
%
% % Test if the second mouse button is pressed.
% if length(buttons)>=2 & buttons(2)
%   fprintf('Someone''s pressing the second button!\n');
% end
%
% length(buttons) tells you how many buttons there are on your mouse.
%
% The cursor position (x,y) is "local", i.e. relative to the origin of
% the window or screen, if supplied. Otherwise it's "global", i.e. relative
% to the origin of the main screen (the one with the menu bar).
% 
% NOTE: If you use GetMouse to wait for clicks, don't forget to wait
% for the user to release the mouse button, ending the current click, before
% you begin waiting for the next mouse press.
%
% Alternatively, you can also use the GetClicks() function to wait for
% mouse-clicks and return the mouse position of first click and the number
% of mouse button clicks.
%
% fprintf('Please click the mouse now.\n');
% [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% while any(buttons) % if already down, wait for release
% 	[x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% end
% while ~any(buttons) % wait for press
% 	[x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% end
% while any(buttons) % wait for release
% 	[x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% end
% fprintf('You clicked! Thanks.\n');
% 
% NOTE: GetMouse no longer supports this obsolete usage:
% xy = GetMouse([windowPtrOrScreenNumber])
% where xy is a 1x2 vector containing the x, y coordinates.
%
% OS X: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% Even if your mouse has more than three buttons, GetMouse will return as
% many values as your mouse has buttons.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
%
% M$-Windows: _____________________________________________________________
%
% Limitations:
%
% GetMouse will always assume a three button mouse and therefore always 
% return the state of three buttons.

% 18/04/06 fwc  fixed bug that prevented use of multiple mice (tested with 3)
% 06/10/06 mk   Added Microsoft Windows support. Removed the old WinPTB GetMouse.dll

% 09/20/06 mk   Updated help section for Windows: GetMouse now also works without onscreen windows.

% We Cache the value of numMouseButtons between calls to GetMouse, so we
% can skip the *very time-consuming* detection code on successive calls.
% This gives a tenfold speedup - important for tight realtime-loops.
