  This file should build on any platform. 

  HISTORY:
  10/23/05  mk		Created. 
 
  DESCRIPTION:
  
  Open a named movie file from the filesystem, create and initialize a corresponding movie object
  and return a handle to it to MATLAB space.
 
  On OS-X, all movie/multimedia handling functions are implemented via the Apple Quicktime API,
  version 7 or later. On a later Windows port we'll probably do the same, but for other OS'es,
  e.g., Linux, we would use a different multimedia engine.
  
  TO DO:

	"Try to open the multimediafile 'moviefile' for playback in onscreen window 'windowPtr' and "
        "return a handle 'moviePtr' on success. On OS-X and Windows, media files are handled by use of "
        "Apples Quicktime-7 API. On other platforms, the playback engine may be different from Quicktime. "
        "The following movie properties are optionally returned: 'duration' Total duration of movie in seconds. "
        "'fps' Video playback framerate, assuming a linear spacing of videoframes in time. There may "
        "exist exotic movie formats which don't have this linear spacing. In that case, 'fps' would "
        "return bogus values and the check for skipped frames would report bogus values as well. "
        "'width' Width of the images contained in the movie. 'height' Height of the images. "
        "'count' Total number of videoframes in the movie. Determined by counting, so querying 'count' "
        "can significantly increase the execution time of this command. "
        "If you want to play multiple movies in succession with lowest possible delay inbetween the movies "
        "then you can ask PTB to load a movie in the background while another movie is still playing: "
        "Call this function with the 'async' flag set to 1. This will initiate the background load operation. "
        "After some sufficient time has passed, you can call the 'OpenMovie' function again, this time with "
        "the 'async' flag set to zero. Now the function will return a valid movie handle for playback. Background "
        "loading of movies is currently only supported on MacOS-X, and it does only work well with movies that "
        "don't have sound.\n"
		"'preloadSecs' This optional parameter allows to ask Screen() to load at least the first 'preloadSecs' "
		"seconds of the movie into system RAM before the function returns. By default, the first second of the "
		"movie file is loaded into RAM. This potentially allows for more stutter free playback, but your mileage "
		"may vary, depending on movie format, storage medium and lots of other factors. In most cases, the default "
		"setting is perfectly sufficient. The special setting -1 means: Load whole movie into RAM. Caution: Long "
		"movies may cause your system to run low on memory and have disastrous effects on playback performance!\n"
        "CAUTION: Some movie files, e.g., MPEG-1 movies sometimes cause Matlab to hang. This seems to be "
        "a bad interaction between parts of Apples Quicktime toolkit and Matlabs Java Virtual Machine (JVM). "
        "If you experience stability problems, please start Matlab with JVM and desktop disabled, e.g., "
        "with the command: 'matlab -nojvm'. An example command sequence in a terminal window could be: "
        "/Applications/MATLAB701/bin/matlab -nojvm ";
