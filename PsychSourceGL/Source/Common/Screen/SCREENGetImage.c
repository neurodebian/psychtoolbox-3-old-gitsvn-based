	HISTORY:
	
		01/08/03  	awi		Created.
		10/12/04	awi		In useString: moved commas to inside [].
		03/20/11	mk		Made 64-bit clean.

	TO DO:
    
		We could probably speed this up by using a single call to glReadPixels instead of three.  It doesn't matter what we pack the result into,
		since we have to iterate over and copy out from the memory which glReadPixels fills so to rearrange correclty into the return matrix. None
		of the glReadPixels modes will fill the return matrix in the same format that MATLAB wants.

"Readback of other onscreen or offscreen windows or textures is possible during async "
"flip, but discouraged because it will have a significant impact on performance.\n\n"
"The returned imageArray by default has three layers, i.e. it's an RGB image. "
"\"windowPtr\" is the handle of the onscreen window, offscreen window or texture whose image "
"should be returned. "
"\"rect\" is the rectangular subregion to copy, and its default is the whole window. "
"Matlab/Octave will complain if you try to do math on a uint8 array, so you may need "
"to use DOUBLE to convert it, e.g. imageArray/255 will produce an error, but "
"double(imageArray)/255 is ok. Also see Screen 'PutImage' and 'CopyWindow'. "
"\"bufferName\" is a string specifying the buffer from which to copy the image: "
"The 'bufferName' argument is meaningless for offscreen windows and textures and "
"will be silently ignored. For onscreen windows, it defaults to 'frontBuffer', i.e., "
"it returns the image that your subject would see at that moment. If frame-sequential "
"stereo mode is enabled, 'frontLeftBuffer' returns what your subject would see in its "
"left eye, 'frontRightBuffer' returns the subjects right-eye view. If double-buffering "
"is enabled, you can also return the 'backBuffer', i.e. what your subject will see after "
"the next Screen('Flip') command, and for frame-sequential stereo also 'backLeftBuffer' "
"and 'backRightBuffer' respectively. 'aux0Buffer' - 'aux3Buffer' returns the content of "
"OpenGL AUX buffers 0 to 3. Only query the AUX buffers if you know what you are doing, "
"otherwise your script will crash. This is mostly meant for internal debugging of PTB. "
"If the imaging pipeline is enabled you can also return the content of the unprocessed "
"backbuffer, ie. before processing by the pipeline, by requesting 'drawBuffer'. \n"
"\"floatprecision\" If you set this optional flag to 1, the image data will be returned "
"as a double precision matrix instead of a uint8 matrix. Please note that normal image "
"data will be returned in the normalized range 0.0 to 1.0 instead of 0 - 255. Floating "
"point readback is only beneficial when reading back floating point precision textures, "
"offscreen windows or the framebuffer when the imaging pipeline is active and HDR mode "
"is selected (ie. more than 8bpc framebuffer).\n"
"\"nrchannels\" Number of color channels to return. By default, 3 channels (RGB) are "

"RGB and 4 for RGBA.\n\n";
