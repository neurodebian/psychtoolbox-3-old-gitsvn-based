"Try to fetch a new image from video capture device 'capturePtr' for visual playback/display in window 'windowPtr' and "
"return a texture-handle 'texturePtr' on successfull completion. 'waitForImage' If set to 1 (default), the function will wait "
"until the image becomes available. If set to zero, the function will just poll for a new image. If none is ready, it will return "
"a texturePtr of zero, or -1 if none will become ready because capture has been stopped. Set 'waitForImage' = 2 if you just want to get the "
"summed intensity or timestamp of the image. 'waitForImage' = 3 will behave as a setting of 2, but it will only poll, not block. The setting "
"'waitForImage' = 4 is special: It will not block, nor will it return any information, but will make sure the capture engine keeps running. "
"This is useful if you want PTB to perform harddisk recording of video footage in the background without any need to access information about "
"the capture process or the actual video data from within Matlab. This is the least ressource consuming way of doing this.\n"
"'oldTexture' (if provided) allows you to pass the texture handle of an already existing texture. "
"Psychtoolbox will reuse that texture by overwriting its previous image content with the new image, instead of creating a completely new "
"texture for the new image. Use of this ''recycling facility'' may allow for higher capture framerates and lower latencies on low-end "
"graphics hardware in some cases. Providing a value of 'oldTexture'=0 is the same as leaving it out. The optional argument 'specialmode' "
"allows to request special treatment of textures. Currently, specialmode = 1 will force PTB to use power-of-two textures instead of other "
"formats. This is usually less efficient, unless you want to do realtime blurring of images. "
"'capturetimestamp' contains the exact system time when the returned image was captured. The (optional) return value 'droppedcount' contains the "
"number of captured frames that had to be dropped to keep in sync with realtime or due to internal shortage of buffer memory. The (optional) return "
"value 'summed_intensity' contains the sum of all pixel intensity values of all channels of the image - some measure of overall brightness. "
"Only query this value if you really need it, its computation is time consuming.";
