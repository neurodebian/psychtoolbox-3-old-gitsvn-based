	DESCRIPTION:
                
        Video Glue consists of PsychScreenGlue, PsychWindowGlue and PsychSurfaceGlue. 
	
		PsychVideoGlue.h is a platform-specific file which contains headers and types which abstract out 
        platform-specific calls for handling displays, windows and surfaces.  The Psychtoolbox uses the 
        term "video" to describe functions which interact with those elements of displays whereas the term
        "graphics" describes drawing functions, which with the Psychtoolbox are all implemented with 
        OpenGL calls and need not be abstracted to use across platforms.
