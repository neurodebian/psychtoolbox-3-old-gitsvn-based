	File:			PsychtoolboxKernelDriver.cpp
	
	Description:	This file implements a I/O Kit driver kernel extension (KEXT) for Psychtoolbox-3.
					The driver allows to augment the standard graphics driver with some useful features
					for visual psychophysics applications. It is orthogonal to the systems driver in that
					it doesn't change that drivers functionality, nor does it interact with that driver.
					
					The driver currently only works on AMD/ATI Radeon graphics cards of the X1000, HD2000
					and HD3000 series. It may work on older ATI cards, but that is not tested or supported.
					
					The driver is experimental in nature, with some small but non-zero chance of causing
					malfunctions or crashes of your system, so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND WITH CAUTION!
					
					The following features are currently supported:
					
					* Time-Stamped Rasterbeamposition queries on Intel-based Macintosh computers.
					* A function to quickly synchronize the video refresh cycles of the two output heads of
					  a dual-head graphics card, e.g., for binocular or stereo stimulation on dual-display setups.
					* Guided queries and logging of a few intersting gfx-state registers for vision science applications.
					* A low level interface for reading- and writing from/to arbitrary gfx-hardware control registers.
					* A dump function that dumps interesting settings to the system log.
					
					The rasterbeamposition queries and fast dual-head syncing are used by Psychtoolbox if
					the driver is loaded at Screen() startup time.
					
					All other features can be accessed by the stand-alone UNIX command line tool
					"PsychtoolboxKernelDriverUserClientTool", to be found in the PsychAlpha subfolder.

	//    smooth out display updates in time for a smooth experience. However, OpenGL/PTB seems to operate
	//    normally and the general system/GUI is still very useable -- A noticeable, but not really problematic
